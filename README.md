This is a onePlace Theme for the popular Boostrap 4 Admin Theme "Vuze" by
[bootlab.io](https://bootlab.io)

All you need is to buy the theme to get the proper js and css files, add them to the assets
folder and you are ready go to!

We already prepared all necessary template files for you, so that you can use VUZE 
for your onePlace based Application.

## Installation

* Buy and download the template on themeforest
> [https://themeforest.net/item/vuze-bootstrap-4-admin-dashboard-template/23215259](https://themeforest.net/item/vuze-bootstrap-4-admin-dashboard-template/23215259)

* Copy the app.js and app.css files to /assets/ css/ and js/ dir of this theme.

Create a folder "vuze" where you place all theme files inside. So you end up with a final 
structure like:
```
.
+-- vuze
|   +-- assets
|   |   +-- css
|   |   |   + app.css
|   |   +-- js
|   |   |   + app.js
|   +-- view
|   |   +-- layout
|   |   |   + layout-vuze.phtml
|   |   +-- partial
|   |   |   + [partials]-vuze.phtml

```
Now you can zip the vuze folder, so you can upload it to oneplace in theme manager.
